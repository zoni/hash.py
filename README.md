hash.py
=======

*A password hasher which generates hashes for /etc/shadow*

Requirements
------------

`hash.py` requires Python 3.3+ and a Unix-like operating system. It makes use of Python's [crypt](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/crypt.html) module from the standard library, which in turn directly uses the *[crypt(3)](http://linux.die.net/man/3/crypt)* routine.

Usage
-----

```
hash.py [-h] [-a HASH_ALGORITHM] [-s SALT]

Calculate password hashes for /etc/shadow

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a HASH_ALGORITHM, --hash-algorithm HASH_ALGORITHM
                        select hash algorithm (md5, blowfish, sha256 or
                        sha512)
  -s SALT, --salt SALT  supply salt to use (randomly generated by default)
```
